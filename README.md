# Underground Pumped Hydroelectric Storage Feasibility Study

Title: Underground Pumped Hydroelectric Storage: A Feasibility Study

Author: Eric Chaves, Syllable Technology and Design

Version: DRAFT 0.0.1

Published: (Not yet published. Draft 0 was released in August 2019)


## Summary
This report discusses climate change and our growing need for energy storage. In particular, it discusses a particular technology called Underground Pumped Hydroelectric Storage.

As energy sources like wind and solar replace fossil fuels, energy storage demand is expected to grow exponentially. This report argues that underground pumped hydro technology could provide plentiful energy storage at an affordable cost. Over long time frames of 40-80 years, this solution could be an order of magnitude cheaper than chemical battery solutions like Lithium Ion.

Our report advocates for further exploration of this technology. And we suggest immediate development in locations which demonstrate profitability.

## The Report
The actual report can be found here: [report.pdf](report.pdf)

The report is compiled using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). The LaTeX base file is [underground-pumped-hydroelectric-storage-feasibility-study.tex](underground-pumped-hydroelectric-storage-feasibility-study.tex). This compiles to a pdf file by the same which is gitignored. This file is then saved as report.pdf for releases.

## Documentation
To edit and compile the report, you will need to install some kind of LaTeX tool. I just use a plugin for sublime text editor. [LaTeXTools: A LaTeX Plugin for Sublime Text 2 and 3](https://latextools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- Initial Commit. Report mostly complete, but in need of editing.

## Project Goals
This report draft should be considered an "amateur" report at the current time. Syllable is a technology and design shop, but we do not have expertise in many of the fields discussed in this report. Furthermore, this report is unsponsored and was so far written on unpaid hours. We hope to partner with field experts to further develop this report in the future.

We have many potential goals for this report:
- To partner with field experts in order to evolve this report further.
- To partner with companies interested in building the technology proposed in this report.
- To raise funds in order to support further work in this area.
