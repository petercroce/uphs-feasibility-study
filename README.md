## The Report
The report can be found here: [report.pdf](report.pdf)

## Summary
This report discusses climate change and our growing need for energy storage. In particular, it discusses a particular technology called Underground Pumped Hydroelectric Storage.

As energy sources like wind and solar replace fossil fuels, energy generation will become more variable, and this is expected to drive an exponential growth in demand for energy storage.

This report argues that underground pumped hydro technology could provide plentiful energy storage at an affordable cost. Over long time frames of 40-80 years, this solution could be an order of magnitude cheaper than chemical battery solutions like Lithium Ion.

As cited below, recent studies have concluded that stationary energy storage demand is expected to grow exponentially and require $662 billion of investment over the next two decades. Our report advocates that underground pumped hydro could capture much of this market away from Lithium Ion battery installations. We suggest further exploration of underground pumped hydro technology. And we suggest immediate development of the technology on sites which may be deemed suitable for profitable installations.


## Documentation
The report is compiled using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). The LaTeX base file is [underground-pumped-hydroelectric-storage-feasibility-study.tex](underground-pumped-hydroelectric-storage-feasibility-study.tex). This compiles to a pdf file by the same which is gitignored. This file is then saved as report.pdf for releases.

To edit and compile the report, you will need to install some kind of LaTeX tool. I just use a plugin for sublime text editor. [LaTeXTools: A LaTeX Plugin for Sublime Text 2 and 3](https://latextools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Project Goals
This report is just a draft at the current time. Syllable is a technology and design shop, but we do not have expertise in many of the fields discussed in this report. We hope to partner with field experts to further develop this report in order to properly publish it in the future.

We have multiple goals for this report:
- To partner with field experts in order to further evolve this report and publish it.
- To partner with companies interested in building underground pumped hydro technology. We are currently pursing warm introductions to the following partners.
    - The Boring Company (Elon Musk and team): Relating to advanced tunnel boring technology.
    - ConsenSys (Joseph Lubin team): Relating to token-funded non-profit projects.
    - NY Green Bank. Relating to funding and partnerships.
    - SUNY State University of New York: Relating to funding and partnerships.


- To raise funds in order to support further work in this area.
    - Support us on [Patreon @syllable_labs](https://www.patreon.com/syllable_labs)
    - To put us in touch with possible partners, please email us at <hello@syllablehq.com>
