### Summary
This report discusses climate change and our growing need for energy storage. In particular, it discusses a particular technology called Underground Pumped Hydroelectric Storage.

As energy sources like wind and solar replace fossil fuels, energy storage demand is expected to grow exponentially. This report argues that underground pumped hydro technology could provide plentiful energy storage at an affordable cost. Over 80 years, this solution could be an order of magnitude cheaper than chemical battery solutions like Lithium Ion.

Our report advocates for further exploration of this technology. And further, we suggest immediate development in test locations which may prove profitable even over shorter time spans.
