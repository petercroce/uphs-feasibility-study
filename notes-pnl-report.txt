A typical conceptual UPHS plant would have a capacity of 1000 to
3000 MW, an operating head of 1000 to 2000 m, and a reservoir storage
capability of 8 to 10 hr generation at full load. An upper reservoir
capacity of about 8 million m 3 is contemplated.

"Including the water it receives from Schoharie Reservoir, Ashokan Reservoir supplies about 40\% of New York City’s daily drinking water needs in non-drought periods."


Domestic cities that are relatively near known favorable bedrock formations include Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Los Angeles, Louisville, Milwaukee, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Omaha, Phoenix, Portland (Oregon), Sacramento, St. Louis, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Tucson, and Washington( D.C.).



The total direct cost of a UPHS plant is estimated at $500 x 10^6 for a
1000-MW plant in 1983 dollars.

Underground pumped hydroelectric storage
has a relatively long construction schedule, so financing costs and escalation can significantly increase cost. This is a substantial commitment for
even a large utility. The justification for such a plant requires high
confidence in utility load predictions, accurate cost estimating, and
excellent predictability of plant performance. Beyond the techni ca 1
considerations, however, the quality of the bond market and availability of
support through a utility consortium may ultimately determine economic
practi cabi 1 i ty.



The underground construction involved does not introduce new techno1 ogy. because experience in this type of work is we 11 defined. The 1 arge
volume of rock to be removed--7 ,400,000 m3 (g,700,000 yd3)--lengthens the
construction period over that of conventional pumped storage by 3 to
3-1/2 yr. which also increases AFDC.


Underground pumped hydroelectric storage compares favorably with
conventional pumped storage. The construction costs were found to be
essentially the same [i.e., in the range of $300 to $350/kW (1978
dollars)]. Operating and maintenance (O&M) costs are essentially the same,
possibly favoring UPHS.

(300 to 350) *  4.37
about $1315 to $1530


Underground pumped hydroelectric storage should appeal to a utility
company in lieu of conventional pumped storage in that it minimizes siteselection and acceptance problems; develops greater head and capacity; is
more applicable in water-scarce areas; and lowers transmission costs and
line losses by being located near load centers.


Proven boring techniques are available with which to confirm geologic site suitability.



Assuming a 4-yr filling period (half the expected construction
period), an average filling flow of 57 l/sec (2 cfs) is required.
(8 year construction estimate)



Four vertical shafts, averaging about 1200 m (4000 ft) in depth, are
required for a typical UPHS plant:
• a penstock shaft connecting the upper reservoir to the pump-turbines
• a lower reservoir vent shaft
• a shaft for primary surface access, including equipment transport, to
the underground powerhouse
• a shaft from the surface for power cables and other lines and secondary access to the underground powerhouse.



Sedimentary rocks that are flat bedded, well lithified, and structurally undeformed are most advantageous for UPHS. In this category is rock
such as limestone, dolomite, impervious sandstone and pre-Cretaceous
indurated sha 1 es.

Devonian Age limestone (~400 Million years ago is pre-cretaceous. Cretaceous is ~100 Million years ago.)

After excavation, the remaining rock should be able to stand alone or
with only minimal support.



2.3 POTOMAC ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY STUDY (1981) The study was sponsored by the Department of Energy and the Electric Power Research Institute. This study is, without a doubt, the definitive design study for UPHS and wi 11 pro vi de the baseline against which a 11 UPHS development in the future will be referenced.



2.3.3 Pumped Storage Plant Layout
A single
penstock wi 11 connect the upper (surface) reservoir to the pump-turbine
units located in a powerhouse at the intermediate level. These units will
connect to an intermediate-level reservoir from which another single
penstock will lead to the pump-turbine units located in a powerhouse at the
lower level. Three 333-i~W pump-turbine/motor-generator units will be
installed in the intermediate powerhouse and three 333-MW units in the
lower powerhouse. Step-up transformation from generator voltage to 500 kV
will be carried out underground; galleries containing the required
equipment will be located directly above and in line with the powerhouse
caverns. The SF6 gas-insulated bus will provide the power circuit connection to the surface. The various excavated powerhouses, reservoirs, and
galleries will be accessible only by vertical shafts from the surface.

The vertical penstocks will have diameters of 5.8 m (19ft) and be
designed for a maximum flow of 153 m3;sec (5400 cfs). Construction of
these and other shafts will be accomplished by sinking from the surface
using conventional drilling and blasting methods.

Provision will also be made for bulkhead gate isolation of the 3.5-m (ll.5-ft) diameter concrete-lined draft
tube outlet tunnels to allow unit unwatering for inspection/maintenance.
All auxiliary systems normally required for pumped storage installations
will be provided with the special features necessary for operation deep
under ground.


The economic feasibility of the UPHS concept will depend substantially
on the ability to rapidly excavate 5 to 6 million m
3 (7 to 8 million yd3)
of rock from substantial depths. The necessary level of performance
2.25
appears to be well within reach of modern construction practice. Excavations of equivalent volumes of rock have been made previously from a
variety of host rocks, and integrity with time has been clearly established.


The required excavation will be in the form of 12 tunnels of substantia 1 cross section, 26 x 20 m ( 85 x 65 ft), interconnected by smaller air
and water collector tunnels at the extreme ends of the reservoir system.
The excavation volume will be 6,012,900 m
3 (7,860,000 yd 3), which will
allow 2.3% for "safety" storage to prevent overfilling of the lower reservoir, and a further 0.3% for freeboard.

They will be constructed at grades that allow free drainage upon dewatering.
Rock support wi 11 be provided by
patterns of rock bolts in the crown and walls of the tunnels augmented by
mesh and shotcrete as required.

2.4 COMMONWEALTH EDISON/HARZA STUDY (1975 to 1981)
for a 3000-MW, 30,000-MWh project.

The site selected by Cmmnonwealth Edison in its service territory is
attractive, and has been demonstrated to be technically feasible for a UPHS
project. The UPHS project appears to be cost-effective and competitive
with oil-fired cycling and peaking generation.

Commonwealth Edison's UPHS study was suspended in January 1980 when
revised load growth projections deferred the anticipated service date.
This deferral provides an excellent opportunity for further development
work on ultra high-head pump-turbines.


2.5 FIFTEEN HUNDRED-METER PUMP-TURBINE STUDY
Because excavation
of the lower reservoir is a dominant cost factor, high heads are necessary
to decrease the required reservoir volume.

3.2 EQUIPMENT/RESERVOIR ARRANGEMENTS
The UPHS design is determined by operating head limits on turbomachinery or "drop" and the excavation economics of the lower reservoir{s).

Preliminary design studies by Acres American, Inc. (1976) evaluated
relative direct cost factors for four of the five arrangements.
Figure 10 gives direct costs for a 2000-MW 10-hr plant design using 300-MW or larger machinery units. The
most economical and practical range, from 3500 to 5000 ft of operating head
(1100 to 1500 m), indicates two-stage reversible pump-turbines as the
preferred machinery. Effects of powerhouse and shaft design, development
feasibility, and reservoir design were considered.


Water in the surface
reservoir may be contaminated with biota that may develop on the walls of
the lower reservoir chambers. Seepage through the bottom of the surface
reservoir may impact the local water table. Seepage of the penstock's
water column into adjacent rock formations may adversely affect aquifer
water quality and/or rock structural stability. (Lack of containment
within the surface reservoir, penstock or the lower reservoir could result
in flooding problems in the powerhouse.) The pumping mode will transfer
geothermal and frictional heat to the upper reservoir. Most potential
problems can be overcome by careful site selection and proper construction
planning. Other environmental concerns involve construction activities,
land use, transmission corridors, increased baseload plant use, and
atmospheric fogging.


Chiu and colleagues (1979) state that the premium fuel savings by a
UPHS plant over an estimated 50-yr life would more than offset the high
initial cost.
Power system and balance-of-plant casts can be reasonably
estimated because the equipment is identical to that used in conventional pumped storage.


4.0 CURRENT AND FUTURE COMMERCIAL STATUS
Despite optimistic forecasts of technical and economic feasibility, so
far no utility has committed funds to the design and construction of a UPHS
plant. According to a recent survey, some feasibility studies have shown
capital cost estimates somewhat greater than for conventional storage
(Battelle Colunbus Laboratories 1982). Accepting these assessments, even
though UPHS has some environmental advantages over conventional pumped
storage, higher cost remains an impediment to significant rna rket
penetration in the near future.

plan details

Two-stage, reversible, regulated pump-turbines are the most promising conceptually for heads of 1000 to 1500 m and unit capacities to 500 MW.


The total direct cost of a UPHS plant is estimated at $500 x 106 for a
1000-MW plant in 1983 dollars.

The lower reservoir of the UPHS plant represents a relatively significant proportion (about 30%)

The nominal operating head can be
developed in one or more 11 Steps 11 , each applied to an individual pumping/
generating plant; this can increase overall nominal operating head and
consequently reduce lower reservoir size.


Quoting from:
2.1 CHARLES T. MAIN STUDY (1978)

The costs for the three scherres ranged from $318/kW to $346/kW [1977
dollars, excluding allowance for funds during construction (AFDC) and escalation

Total estimated cost of the multistage reversible unit
scheme, the most advantageous, was $636,500,000 (at the 1977 price level)
including contingencies, engineering, supervision, and overhead but
excluding AFOC and escalation.

$2,786,923,000 -- about 2.8 billion.

The underground construction involved does not introduce new techno1 ogy. because experience in this type of work is we 11 defined. The 1 arge
volume of rock to be removed--7 ,400,000 m3 (g,700,000 yd3)--lengthens the
construction period over that of conventional pumped storage by 3 to
3-1/2 yr. which also increases AFDC.
(allowance for funds during construction)

A reservoir with storage capacity to stare a water supply for 20,000
MWH at 1200-m (4000-ft) head is typical of the UPHS projects judged most
feasible. The volume of such a reservoir is 7.9 million m
3 (6400 acre-ft),
so that if its average depth is 10m (33ft), its area will be 81 ha (200
acres or 0. 31 sq mi).

Such a reservoir requires no unusual topography. The material required to be excavated from the mined lower reservoir should be more than
sufficient to form the structural enclosure for the upper reservoir.

Assuming a 4-yr filling period (half the expected construction
period), an average filling flow of 57 l/sec (2 cfs) is required. This is
the normal average surface water runoff rate from a drainage area of 3.5 sq
km (1.35 sq mi) in a typical temperate zone.

2.3 POTOMAC ELECTRIC POWER COMPANY STUDY (1981)

The study was sponsored by the Department of Energy and the Electric Power
Research Institute. This study is, without a doubt, the definitive design
study for UPHS and wi 11 pro vi de the baseline against which a 11 UPHS
development in the future will be referenced.

Basic requirements:
a generating capacity of 2000 MW
a level of energy storage that would permit generation at full output
for 10 hr

The study established a preference for a "two-step" arrangement with each
step consisting of a 1000-MW plant operating at a nominal head of 762 m
(2500 ft). This enabled adoption of an overall nominal operating head of
1525 m (5000 ft).

The facility was arranged to permit construction in two
phases, the first to provide 1333 M'W of generating capacity and the second
phase to complete the remaining 667 MW of capacity.

Two-thirds of the
lower reservoir will be excavated during the first phase of construction,
with the remainder being completed during the second phase (Willett 1981).


It is located at Sunshine, Maryland, southwest of
the Triadelphia Reservoir in Montgomery County, approximately 20 mi north
of Washington, D.C., and about 20 mi southwest of Baltimore, Maryland. The
site covers approximately 500 acres and is crossed by a 500-kV transmission
line owned by PEPCO.

geologic mapping was
The second part of the investigation involved a deep drilling
program, with continuous rock coring together with an in-hole testing
program to determine stress conditions and permeability levels and to
provide a geophysical log of the formation.


(determine bedrock overlay depth)


... nonregulating multistage pump-turbines designed in
accordance with very high head pump practice and accommodating heads of
over 1220 m (4000 ft) with four- or five-stage machines has been developed
in Europe.

Multiple designs were considered and determined to be feasible. Chosen:
The PEPCO study was finally based on an SSRPT-2 arrangement with an
over a 11 nomina 1 head of 1525 m ( 5000 ft). Each step consisted of three
pump-turbine/motor-generator sets, each of 333-i-M rating and each operating
at 720 rpm under a nominal head of 762 m (2500 ft).

(room for tech improvement)


Three 333-i~W pump-turbine/motor-generator units will be
installed in the intermediate powerhouse and three 333-MW units in the
lower powerhouse.
Step-up transformation from generator voltage to 500 kV
will be carried out underground;

The SF6 gas-insulated bus will provide the power circuit connection to the surface. The various excavated powerhouses, reservoirs, and
galleries will be accessible only by vertical shafts from the surface.


In addition to the vertical penstock shaft leading from the upper
reservoir intake/outflow structure to the pumped storage plants below, four
other shafts will be constructed ranging in depth from 1525 to 1677 m (5000
to 5500 ft). Three of these shafts will contain hoisting conveyances, SF6
bus for main power transmission, and control cables. The fourth, an air
vent shaft, will allow atmospheric air admission to and from the lower and
intermediate reservoirs.

The vertical penstocks will have diameters of 5.8 m (19ft) and be
designed for a maximum flow of 153 m3;sec (5400 cfs).

Construction of
these and other shafts will be accomplished by sinking from the surface
using conventional drilling and blasting methods.


The penstock walls will
have rock bo 1 t support and a permanent concrete 1 i ni ng provided with a
drainage system. The penstocks will turn to the horizontal at the powerhouse levels, and concrete-lined manifolds will form three 3.35-m (11-ft)
diameter penstocks at each level. An 88-m (290-ft) length of the penstocks
upstream from the powerhouses will be lined with 7-cm (2 3/4-in.) thick
high-strength steel lines that have flanged connection penstock valves
upstream of the pump-turbine spiral cases.

the nominal head on each of the two
powerhouses will be limited to 762 m (2500 ft).

 the intermediate reservoir will have sufficient capacity to
accept a vo 1 ume of "storage" equi va 1 ent to the fu 11 discharge of three
pump-turbine units operating for 15 min.

both steps: "identical layout and design".

 Each will accommodate three 333-ivfW motorgenerator units with associated pump-turbines operating at 720 rpm and
equipped with 1.64-m (64.6-in.) diameter spherical penstock valves. governors, and facilities for pump starting with a static frequency converter.

Provision will also be made for bulkhead gate isolation of the 3.5-m (ll.5-ft) diameter concrete-lined draft
tube outlet tunnels to allow unit unwatering for inspection/maintenance.

The economic feasibility of the UPHS concept will depend substantially
on the ability to rapidly excavate 5 to 6 million m
3 (7 to 8 million yd3)
of rock from substantial depths.

The necessary level of performance appears to be well within reach of modern construction practice. Excavations of equivalent volumes of rock have been made previously from a variety of host rocks, and integrity with time has been clearly established.



The required excavation will be in the form of 12 tunnels of substantial cross section, 26 x 20 m ( 85 x 65 ft), interconnected by smaller air and water collector tunnels at the extreme ends of the reservoir system.

The excavation volume will be 6,012,900 m^3 (7,860,000 yd 3), which will
allow 2.3% for "safety" storage to prevent overfilling of the lower reservoir, and a further 0.3% for freeboard. Two-thirds of this volume will be
provided for the first phase, and the remainder will be constructed to
complete the plant in Phase 2. The main tunnels in the lower reservoir
will be oriented with their axes approximately perpendicular to the strike
of the rock foliation, since this will provide more desirable conditions
for rock support of the larger spans. The interconnecting tunnels will be
of small cross section and can be safely constructed with the less desirable rock conditions in line with the strike of the rock foliation. All of
the storage caverns within the lower reservoir will have curved side walls
to reduce tensile stress zones. They will be constructed at grades that
a 11 ow free drainage upon dewatering. Rock support will be provided by
patterns of rock bolts in the crown and walls of the tunnels augmented by
mesh and shotcrete as required. The final design will depend on future
exploratory work and on experience gained in the development of the initial
underground facilities. Provision will be made for isolation of any one third of the reservoir with "stoplogs" to permit reservoir cavern inspection without disrupting plant operation.
